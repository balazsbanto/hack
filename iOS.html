    <h2>Understanding iOS Frida Dump: What, Why, and How</h2>
    <p>
      One of the most powerful tools in iOS reverse engineering is <strong>dumping a decrypted .ipa</strong> from a running app using <code>Frida</code>.
      This process is essential for analyzing apps downloaded from the App Store.
    </p>

    <h3>üîç What Is It?</h3>
    <p>
      iOS apps from the App Store are encrypted with Apple‚Äôs <strong>FairPlay DRM</strong>.
      Even if you manage to extract the app files from your device, the binary remains encrypted and unreadable to reverse engineering tools like
      Ghidra, Hopper, or IDA.
    </p>

    <h3>üí° Why It‚Äôs Useful</h3>
    <p>
      To reverse engineer or analyze an iOS app, you need access to the app‚Äôs <strong>decrypted binary</strong>.
      Since iOS automatically decrypts the app in memory when it runs, this gives us a perfect opportunity to intercept it.
    </p>

    <h3>üß™ How It Works</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Launch the target iOS app on a jailbroken device</li>
      <li>Use <code>Frida</code> to attach to the app's process while it's running</li>
      <li>Frida reads the decrypted binary from memory</li>
      <li>The binary is then reconstructed and saved as a <code>.ipa</code> or <code>.app</code> file</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Once saved, you can open the dumped binary with your favorite reverse engineering tools.
